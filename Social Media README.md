# SocialMedia_BS5.2
In this project, I tried to build a social media by practicing my HTML and CSS Skills. 
Regarding the login.html, I built a beautiful login form where the user would have access to connect using his social media like twitter of facebook. 
login.css : All the CSS box properties have been applied, like margin, flex properties, 
In the index.html and index.css pages, you are able to find epresent the first page where you load in a browser. Practicing many html and css flexbox properties.
